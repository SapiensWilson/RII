       <div class="section-title">
         <h2>New Section Title</h2>
         <p>Short description of the new section.</p>
       </div>
       <!-- Add your section content here -->
     </div>
   </section>
   <!-- End New Section -->
   ```
   Replace `new-section` and `New Section Title` with appropriate names and content for your section.
4. If needed, add custom styles for your new section in the `assets/css/style.css` file.
